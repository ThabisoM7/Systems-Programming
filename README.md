# Systems-Programming-Lab

This is my personal lab where I sharpen my systems programming — the low-level, nuts-and-bolts side of software development.

The goal of this lab is to sharpen my skills in:

Writing programs that interact directly with the operating system.

Working with memory, files, processes, and system calls.

Building small but powerful tools in C/C++ (and maybe a bit of assembly).

Using PowerShell scripting to automate tasks, analyze systems, and create my own utilities.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Soon we will inolve more C++ to be able to talk under the hood a little more

In here you’ll find:

Experiments with file handling, process creation, and network sockets.

Memory management exercises (malloc, free, pointers).

This repo is not a polished product — it’s my playground for learning, breaking things, and figuring out how things work under the hood.
